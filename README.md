## 🧠 Learning Goals

This project was created to reinforce core React concepts:

- **useState** for managing component and app-level state
- **Immutable Updates** using `map()` for arrays
- **Props & Event Handlers**: Parent-child communication
- **Derived State**: Calculate paid-by-friend based on inputs
- **Conditional Rendering**: Render bill form and add form dynamically
- Controlled form inputs: `input`, `select`
